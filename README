# what is this

memSym stands for "memory simulator"
it is a process memory allocation simulation software built in C
which allows you to visualize in realtime mainly through the UI
how a virtual processor manages a computer's central memory for
processes execution after being loaded to the RAM without dismissing
the fact that each operation is followed by a particular sound to
provide a maximum user experience and understanding of each system state

# how to run it

there are 3 ways to run the program it depends on your operating system

it is recommanded to be on a Linux OS as it provides the best developer
experience ever and a full control over your system, and most importantly
the software was built and tested on a custom Linux Kernel
(Linux Arch with xfce/Gnome display server, x11 windowing system
coupled with an i5-6300U CPU @ 2.40GHz quad core)
so it's garenteed that it will be compatible with the system's drivers as long as
you are using any Linux Distro

on windows there is a small probability of facing some compatibility 
issues which will be discussed later renforced by the fact it wasnt
tested on any windows version

- Linux
the easy and direct way to run memSym is to directly use the main binary
since it is the compilation result of our source files 
so you don't need to worry about having a c compiler

another way is to recompile the codebase which is useless if you don't want
to change something in the code
to do so, you need first to have the gcc compiler installed in your system
which is avaible by default in some linux ditros such Ubuntu 
(you can use any compiler you want but gcc is recommanded as it was used in this project)
now if you have a basic knowledge about compilers you could easily compile everything
by including the required header files that would be mentioned later then you run the binary
else a python script was written to do compilation process for you using gcc and run the project 
just to avoid type the long command and including the header files
so you just need to run the compile.py file after installing the python interpreter in your system

- Windows


# how to use it

after running the program you can see an User Interface that contains
3 sections in a row

# what does it do



the virtual processor is by default defined in the program by
its specs which are:
*a clock speed of 4Hz (1 clock tick each 250ms)
*a 3 levels iStack (3 levels of priority)
*3 iQueues of 10 processes slots each
*30 pending processes slots according to the iStack
and iQueues specs
*a 1024Bytes RAM (1KB)


# how it works

gameloop concept

# how was it made

- project directory structure
- used tools & requirements

- sdl
  -widgets(draw update ...)
  -gameloop
  -mainloop
  -eventloop

- sound system

- userData concept + custom scripting langage

- funcs
  -dataStructs

- compilation

- merging

-git+Github
